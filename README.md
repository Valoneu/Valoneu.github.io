# Valoneu's Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Features

*   **Interactive Design:** Uses various animations, transitions, particle effects, and hover effects (like 3D card tilts).
*   **Responsive:** Adapts to look good on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, phones).
*   **Light/Dark Theme:** Includes a theme switcher and respects the user's system preference.
*   **Content Sections:** Includes sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, and a Blog.
*   **Project Filtering:** Allows users to filter projects by category (Code, 3D Art, etc.) with smooth transitions.
*   **Custom Cursor:** Features an animated cursor effect on desktop browsers.
*   **Blog Layout:** Blog posts use a specific design with code syntax highlighting.
*   **Technologies:** Built with HTML, CSS (Variables, Grid, Flexbox), vanilla JavaScript, Prism.js (for code highlighting), and the particles.js library.

## Files Included

## Design Goal

The goal was to create a portfolio that is visually interesting and engaging. It uses modern web technologies to showcase my work. It also includes considerations for accessibility, like respecting reduced motion preferences.
